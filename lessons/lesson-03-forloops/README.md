# Loops

## Exercises

### Exercise 1:

Write a program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. (e.g. numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

### Exercise 2:

Create a tuple of numbers 1-10. In a for loop, print out all numbers except those divisible by 3.

### Exercise 3:

Create an array of strings (e.g. animals). Loop through each string then loop through and print each character of the string individually.
